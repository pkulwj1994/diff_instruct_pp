# Diff-Instruct++: Training One-step Text-to-image Generator Model to Align with Human Preferences [[Huggingface](https://github.com/pkulwj1994/diff_instruct_pp)][[Colab](https://github.com/pkulwj1994/diff_instruct_pp)]

Welcome to the official repository for **Diff-Instruct++** (DI++), a novel preference alignment approach for DiT-based 1-step text-to-image generative models. Diff-Instruct\* is built upon a new **KL-based RLHF** theory, which **improves human preferences while maintaining the advantage of 1-step generation**.
